/**
 * Readers — reader accounts, kept strictly separate from `Users`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This collection is an addition to the original content model**, and the
 * reason is structural: the retained feature set includes comments with
 * Facebook/Google login, reader bookmarks, saved deadlines and push
 * notifications. All four need a persistent reader identity, and
 * `.sps/content-model.md` models `SavedDeadlines.reader` as a relation — which
 * requires a collection to relate to.
 *
 * Why not reuse `Users`: `Users` is the newsroom's staff collection with
 * publishing power. Mixing readers into it would mean every reader account sits
 * one field-level mistake away from editorial access. Separate collections make
 * that impossible by construction.
 *
 * No passwords: readers authenticate through a social provider
 * (`.sps/plan.md` — "Custom Payload comments (Facebook/Google social login)").
 * The auth config below makes that structural rather than a convention — see the
 * note on `disableLocalStrategy`.
