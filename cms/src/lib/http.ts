 * Shared helpers for the public write endpoints.
 *
 * The S9 endpoints (`newsletter`, `citizen`, `comments`) are three narrow
 * operations on public surfaces, and all three need the same four things:
 * read a JSON body without trusting it, find the caller's IP, answer with a
 * status code, and treat a filled honeypot as a silent success. Those lived
 * copy-pasted in each file until there were three of them.
 *
 * ## The honeypot rule, stated once
 *
 * A filled honeypot must return a **normal-looking success without writing**.
 * Returning an error tells the bot which field caught it, and the next attempt
 * fills the field correctly. This is why `isHoneypotFilled` is checked before
 * anything else in every handler.
